# Parallel Voting

In Parallel Voting each voter casts two votes.

1. *First Vote* : This is used to decide winner of each constituency by First Past The Post system. This is used to fill *Member Seats* of the parliment.
2. *Second Vote* : This is used to fill *List Seats* of each political party in Parliament.  Here will allot extra seats to each party till it is over-represented and then move on to next political party. This is the main difference from MMPR where secondary votes decide representation of whole parliment but in Parallel Voting they are used to give representation in List Seaats only.

## Implementation

1. `constructor` 
   - creates the contract with required number of `seats` and initialises `size` of the Parliament as `2*seats`
   - sets the `chairperson` of the contract.

2. `requestRightToVote` 
   - seat of voter as argument
   - caller of this method are stored in `provisionalVoters` array if they haven't voted or autherized already.

3. `giveRightToVote`
   - `chairperson` can call this method to autherize all users in `provisionalList` to vote

 4. `castVote`
   - each autherized voter can cast 2 votes

5. `result`
   - First gives `seats` to party by FPTP in each seat.
   - Remaining 50% seats are filled by allocating candidates to each party until it is over-represented in List Seats.
